If adequate mitigation of the disparity is not possible, then the use of the automated system should be reconsidered.

The purpose of these convenings \u2013 recordings of which are publicly available online[112] \u2013 was to bring together a variety of experts, practitioners, advocates and federal government officials to offer insights and analysis on the risks, harms, benefits, and policy opportunities of automated systems. Each panel discussion was organized around a wide-ranging theme, exploring current challenges and concerns and considering what an automated society that respects democratic values should look like. These discussions focused on the topics of consumer rights and protections, the criminal justice system, equal opportunities and civil justice, artificial intelligence and democratic values, social welfare and development, and the healthcare system.\n\n**Summaries of Panel Discussions:** **Panel 1: Consumer Rights and Protections.

In direct prompt injections, attackers might craft malicious prompts and input them directly to a GAI system, with a variety of downstream negative consequences to interconnected systems. Indirect prompt injection attacks occur when adversaries remotely (i.e., without a direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by injecting prompts into data likely to be retrieved. Security researchers have already demonstrated how indirect prompt injections can exploit vulnerabilities by stealing proprietary data or running malicious code remotely on a machine. Merely querying a closed production model can elicit previously undisclosed information about that model.\n\n Another cybersecurity risk to GAI is data poisoning, in which an adversary compromises a training dataset used by a model to manipulate its outputs or operation. Malicious tampering with data or parts of the model could exacerbate risks associated with GAI system outputs.\n\n Trustworthy AI Characteristics: Privacy Enhanced, Safe, Secure and Resilient, Valid and Reliable\n\n 2.10. Intellectual Property\n\n Intellectual property risks from GAI systems may arise where the use of copyrighted works is not a fair use under the fair use doctrine. If a GAI system\u2019s training data included copyrighted material, GAI outputs displaying instances of training data memorization (see Data Privacy above) could infringe on copyright.\n\n How GAI relates to copyright, including the status of generated content that is similar to but does not strictly copy work protected by copyright, is currently being debated in legal fora.

Some aspects of GAI outputs, such as the production of deepfake content, can challenge our ability to distinguish human-generated content from AI-generated synthetic content. To help manage and mitigate these risks, digital transparency mechanisms like provenance data tracking can trace the origin and history of content. Provenance data tracking and synthetic content detection can help facilitate greater information access about both authentic and synthetic content to users, enabling better knowledge of trustworthiness in AI systems. When combined with other organizational accountability mechanisms, digital content transparency approaches can enable processes to trace negative outcomes back to their source, improve information integrity, and uphold public trust.

Additionally, these systems can produce feedback loops and compounded harm, collecting data from communities and using it to reinforce inequality.

Education-related concerning uses included the increased use of remote proctoring systems, student location and facial recognition tracking, teacher evaluation systems, robot teachers, and more. Housing-related concerning uses including automated tenant background screening and facial recognition-based controls to enter or exit housing complexes. Employment-related concerning uses included discrimination in automated hiring screening and workplace surveillance. Various panelists raised the limitations of existing privacy law as a key concern, pointing out that students should be able to reinvent themselves and require privacy of their student records and education-related data in order to do so. The overarching concerns of surveillance in these domains included concerns about the chilling effects of surveillance on student expression, inappropriate control of tenants via surveillance, and the way that surveillance of workers blurs the boundary between work and life and exerts extreme and potentially damaging control over workers' lives. Additionally, some panelists pointed out ways that data from one situation was misapplied in another in a way that limited people's opportunities, for example data from criminal justice settings or previous evictions being used to block further access to housing. Throughout, various panelists emphasized that these technologies are being used to shift the burden of oversight and efficiency from employers to workers, schools to students, and landlords to tenants, in ways that diminish and encroach on equality of opportunity; assessment of these technologies should include whether they are genuinely helpful in solving an identified problem.", "206e9c80-23f2-4285-bb79-245bcba80a33": "Action ID: GV-6.1-005\nSuggested Action: Implement a use-cased based supplier risk assessment framework to evaluate and\nmonitor third-party entities\u2019 performance and adherence to content provenance\nstandards and technologies to detect anomalies and unauthorized changes;\nservices acquisition and value chain risk management; and legal compliance.\nGAI Risks: Data Privacy; Information\nIntegrity; Information Security;\nIntellectual Property; Value Chain\nand Component Integration", "c70eb309-4d7f-423b-8d8e-0efd4d6f063c": "Action ID: MS-2.7-005\nSuggested Action: Measure reliability of content authentication methods, such as watermarking,\ncryptographic signatures, digital fingerprints, as well as access controls,\nconformity assessment, and model integrity verification, which can help support\nthe effective implementation of content provenance techniques.
