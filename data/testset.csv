1,How does the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights aim to inform private and public involvement with automated system development?,"['SECTION TITLE\n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplying The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \nRELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING LAW AND POLICY\nThere are regulatory safety requirements for medical devices, as well as sector-, population-, or technology-spe\xad\ncific privacy and security protections. Ensuring some of the additional protections proposed in this framework \nwould require new laws to be enacted or new policies and practices to be adopted. In some cases, exceptions to \nthe principles described in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights may be necessary to comply with existing law, \nconform to the practicalities of a specific use case, or balance competing public interests. In particular, law \nenforcement, and other regulatory contexts may require government actors to protect civil rights, civil liberties, \nand privacy in a manner consistent with, but using alternate mechanisms to, the specific principles discussed in \nthis framework. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is meant to assist governments and the private sector in \nmoving principles into practice. \nThe expectations given in the Technical Companion are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of \nadditional technical standards and practices that should be tailored for particular sectors and contexts. While \nexisting laws informed the development of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, this framework does not detail \nthose laws beyond providing them as examples, where appropriate, of existing protective measures. This \nframework instead shares a broad, forward-leaning vision of recommended principles for automated system \ndevelopment and use to inform private and public involvement with these systems where they have the poten\xad\ntial to meaningfully impact rights, opportunities, or access. Additionally, this framework does not analyze or \ntake a position on legislative and regulatory proposals in municipal, state, and federal government, or those in \nother countries. \nWe have seen modest progress in recent years, with some state and local governments responding to these prob\xad\nlems with legislation, and some courts extending longstanding statutory protections to new and emerging tech\xad\nnologies. There are companies working to incorporate additional protections in their design and use of auto\xad\nmated systems, and researchers developing innovative guardrails. Advocates, researchers, and government \norganizations have proposed principles for the ethical use of AI and other automated systems. These include \nthe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) 2019 Recommendation on Artificial \nIntelligence, which includes principles for responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI and which the United \nStates adopted, and Executive Order 13960 on Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the \nFederal Government, which sets out principles that govern the federal government’s use of AI. The Blueprint \nfor an AI Bill of Rights is fully consistent with these principles and with the direction in Executive Order 13985 \non Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. \nThese principles find kinship in the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs), derived from the 1973 report \nof an advisory committee to the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Records, Computers, \nand the Rights of Citizens.4 While there is no single, universal articulation of the FIPPs, these core \nprinciples for managing information about individuals have been incorporated into data privacy laws and \npolicies across the globe.5 The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights embraces elements of the FIPPs that are \nparticularly relevant to automated systems, without articulating a specific set of FIPPs or scoping \napplicability or the interests served to a single particular domain, like privacy, civil rights and civil liberties, \nethics, or risk management. The Technical Companion builds on this prior work to provide practical next \nsteps to move these principles into practice and promote common approaches that allow technological \ninnovation to flourish while protecting people from harm. \n9\n']","The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights aims to assist governments and the private sector in moving principles into practice, providing a broad, forward-leaning vision of recommended principles for automated system development and use.

2,What expectations should be met by automated systems in terms of data privacy?,"[' \n \n \n \n \n \nDATA PRIVACY \nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nProtect the public from unchecked surveillance \nHeightened oversight of surveillance. Surveillance or monitoring systems should be subject to \nheightened oversight that includes at a minimum assessment of potential harms during design (before deploy\xad\nment) and in an ongoing manner, to ensure that the American public’s rights, opportunities, and access are \nprotected. This assessment should be done before deployment and should give special attention to ensure \nthere is not algorithmic discrimination, especially based on community membership, when deployed in a \nspecific real-world context. Such assessment should then be reaffirmed in an ongoing manner as long as the \nsystem is in use. \nLimited and proportionate surveillance. Surveillance should be avoided unless it is strictly necessary \nto achieve a legitimate purpose and it is proportionate to the need. Designers, developers, and deployers of \nsurveillance systems should use the least invasive means of monitoring available and restrict monitoring to the \nminimum number of subjects possible. To the greatest extent possible consistent with law enforcement and \nnational security needs, individuals subject to monitoring should be provided with clear and specific notice \nbefore it occurs and be informed about how the data gathered through surveillance will be used. \nScope limits on surveillance to protect rights and democratic values. Civil liberties and civil \nrights must not be limited by the threat of surveillance or harassment facilitated or aided by an automated \nsystem. Surveillance systems should not be used to monitor the exercise of democratic rights, such as voting, \nprivacy, peaceful assembly, speech, or association, in a way that limits the exercise of civil rights or civil liber\xad\nties. Information about or algorithmically-determined assumptions related to identity should be carefully \nlimited if used to target or guide surveillance systems in order to avoid algorithmic discrimination; such iden\xad\ntity-related information includes group characteristics or affiliations, geographic designations, location-based \nand association-based inferences, social networks, and biometrics. Continuous surveillance and monitoring \nsystems should not be used in physical or digital workplaces (regardless of employment status), public educa\xad\ntional institutions, and public accommodations. Continuous surveillance and monitoring systems should not \nbe used in a way that has the effect of limiting access to critical resources or services or suppressing the exer\xad\ncise of rights, even where the organization is not under a particular duty to protect those rights. \nProvide the public with mechanisms for appropriate and meaningful consent, access, and \ncontrol over their data \nUse-specific consent. Consent practices should not allow for abusive surveillance practices. Where data \ncollectors or automated systems seek consent, they should seek it for specific, narrow use contexts, for specif\xad\nic time durations, and for use by specific entities. Consent should not extend if any of these conditions change; \nconsent should be re-acquired before using data if the use case changes, a time limit elapses, or data is trans\xad\nferred to another entity (including being shared or sold). Consent requested should be limited in scope and \nshould not request consent beyond what is required. Refusal to provide consent should be allowed, without \nadverse effects, to the greatest extent possible based on the needs of the use case. \nBrief and direct consent requests. When seeking consent from users short, plain language consent \nrequests should be used so that users understand for what use contexts, time span, and entities they are \nproviding data and metadata consent. User experience research should be performed to ensure these consent \nrequests meet performance standards for readability and comprehension. This includes ensuring that consent \nrequests are accessible to users with disabilities and are available in the language(s) and reading level appro\xad\npriate for the audience.  User experience design choices that intentionally obfuscate or manipulate user \nchoice (i.e., “dark patterns”) should be not be used. \n34\n']","The expectations for automated systems in terms of data privacy include protecting the public from unchecked surveillance, ensuring heightened oversight of surveillance, limiting and proportionate surveillance, scoping limits on surveillance to protect rights and democratic values, and providing the public with mechanisms for appropriate and meaningful consent, access, and control over their data.",simple,"[{'source': 'data/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf', 'page': 33, 'total_pages': 73, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Adobe Illustrator 26.3 (Macintosh)', 'producer': 'iLovePDF', 'creationDate': ""D:20220920133035-04'00'"", 'modDate': ""D:20221003104118-04'00'"", 'trapped': ''}]",True

5,What advantages does The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights offer in safeguarding domain-specific sensitive data?,"[' \n \n \nApplying The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights \nSENSITIVE DATA: Data and metadata are sensitive if they pertain to an individual in a sensitive domain \n(defined below); are generated by technologies used in a sensitive domain; can be used to infer data from a \nsensitive domain or sensitive data about an individual (such as disability-related data, genomic data, biometric \ndata, behavioral data, geolocation data, data related to interaction with the criminal justice system, relationship \nhistory and legal status such as custody and divorce information, and home, work, or school environmental \ndata); or have the reasonable potential to be used in ways that are likely to expose individuals to meaningful \nharm, such as a loss of privacy or financial harm due to identity theft. Data and metadata generated by or about \nthose who are not yet legal adults is also sensitive, even if not related to a sensitive domain. Such data includes, \nbut is not limited to, numerical, text, image, audio, or video data. \nSENSITIVE DOMAINS: “Sensitive domains” are those in which activities being conducted can cause material \nharms, including significant adverse effects on human rights such as autonomy and dignity, as well as civil liber\xad\nties and civil rights. Domains that have historically been singled out as deserving of enhanced data protections \nor where such enhanced protections are reasonably expected by the public include, but are not limited to, \nhealth, family planning and care, employment, education, criminal justice, and personal finance. In the context \nof this framework, such domains are considered sensitive whether or not the specifics of a system context \nwould necessitate coverage under existing law, and domains and data that are considered sensitive are under\xad\nstood to change over time based on societal norms and context. \nSURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY: “Surveillance technology” refers to products or services marketed for \nor that can be lawfully used to detect, monitor, intercept, collect, exploit, preserve, protect, transmit, and/or \nretain data, identifying information, or communications concerning individuals or groups. This framework \nlimits its focus to both government and commercial use of surveillance technologies when juxtaposed with \nreal-time or subsequent automated analysis and when such systems have a potential for meaningful impact \non individuals’ or communities’ rights, opportunities, or access. \nUNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES: The term “underserved communities” refers to communities that have \nbeen systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as \nexemplified by the list in the preceding definition of “equity.” \n11\n', ' \n \n \n \nDATA PRIVACY \nEXTRA PROTECTIONS FOR DATA RELATED TO SENSITIVE\nDOMAINS\nSome domains, including health, employment, education, criminal justice, and personal finance, have long been \nsingled out as sensitive domains deserving of enhanced data protections. This is due to the intimate nature of these \ndomains as well as the inability of individuals to opt out of these domains in any meaningful way, and the \nhistorical discrimination that has often accompanied data knowledge.69 Domains understood by the public to be \nsensitive also change over time, including because of technological developments. Tracking and monitoring \ntechnologies, personal tracking devices, and our extensive data footprints are used and misused more than ever \nbefore; as such, the protections afforded by current legal guidelines may be inadequate. The American public \ndeserves assurances that data related to such sensitive domains is protected and used appropriately and only in \nnarrowly defined contexts with clear benefits to the individual and/or society. \nTo this end, automated systems that collect, use, share, or store data related to these sensitive domains should meet \nadditional expectations. Data and metadata are sensitive if they pertain to an individual in a sensitive domain (defined \nbelow); are generated by technologies used in a sensitive domain; can be used to infer data from a sensitive domain or \nsensitive data about an individual (such as disability-related data, genomic data, biometric data, behavioral data, \ngeolocation data, data related to interaction with the criminal justice system, relationship history and legal status such \nas custody and divorce information, and home, work, or school environmental data); or have the reasonable potential \nto be used in ways that are likely to expose individuals to meaningful harm, such as a loss of privacy or financial harm \ndue to identity theft.

6,How can equity be ensured in automated system design and reported for public accountability?,"[' \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS\nThe expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional \ntechnical standards and practices that are tailored for particular sectors and contexts. \nAny automated system should be tested to help ensure it is free from algorithmic discrimination before it can be \nsold or used. Protection against algorithmic discrimination should include designing to ensure equity, broadly \nconstrued.  Some algorithmic discrimination is already prohibited under existing anti-discrimination law. The \nexpectations set out below describe proactive technical and policy steps that can be taken to not only \nreinforce those legal protections but extend beyond them to ensure equity for underserved communities48 \neven in circumstances where a specific legal protection may not be clearly established. These protections \nshould be instituted throughout the design, development, and deployment process and are described below \nroughly in the order in which they would be instituted. \nProtect the public from algorithmic discrimination in a proactive and ongoing manner \nProactive assessment of equity in design. Those responsible for the development, use, or oversight of \nautomated systems should conduct proactive equity assessments in the design phase of the technology \nresearch and development or during its acquisition to review potential input data, associated historical \ncontext, accessibility for people with disabilities, and societal goals to identify potential discrimination and \neffects on equity resulting from the introduction of the technology. The assessed groups should be as inclusive \nas possible of the underserved communities mentioned in the equity definition:  Black, Latino, and Indigenous \nand Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of \nreligious minorities; women, girls, and non-binary people; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and inter-\nsex (LGBTQI+) persons; older adults; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons \notherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Assessment could include both qualitative \nand quantitative evaluations of the system. This equity assessment should also be considered a core part of the \ngoals of the consultation conducted as part of the safety and efficacy review. \nRepresentative and robust data. Any data used as part of system development or assessment should be \nrepresentative of local communities based on the planned deployment setting and should be reviewed for bias \nbased on the historical and societal context of the data. Such data should be sufficiently robust to identify and \nhelp to mitigate biases and potential harms. \nGuarding against proxies.  Directly using demographic information in the design, development, or \ndeployment of an automated system (for purposes other than evaluating a system for discrimination or using \na system to counter discrimination) runs a high risk of leading to algorithmic discrimination and should be \navoided. In many cases, attributes that are highly correlated with demographic features, known as proxies, can \ncontribute to algorithmic discrimination. In cases where use of the demographic features themselves would \nlead to illegal algorithmic discrimination, reliance on such proxies in decision-making (such as that facilitated \nby an algorithm) may also be prohibited by law. Proactive testing should be performed to identify proxies by \ntesting for correlation between demographic information and attributes in any data used as part of system \ndesign, development, or use.

Additionally, automated systems used within \nsensitive domains should meet these expectations: \nNarrowly scoped data and inferences. Human oversight should ensure that automated systems in \nsensitive domains are narrowly scoped to address a defined goal, justifying each included data item or attri\xad\nbute as relevant to the specific use case. Data included should be carefully limited to avoid algorithmic \ndiscrimination resulting from, e.g., use of community characteristics, social network analysis, or group-based \ninferences. \nTailored to the situation. Human oversight should ensure that automated systems in sensitive domains \nare tailored to the specific use case and real-world deployment scenario, and evaluation testing should show \nthat the system is safe and effective for that specific situation. Validation testing performed based on one loca\xad\ntion or use case should not be assumed to transfer to another. \nHuman consideration before any high-risk decision. Automated systems, where they are used in \nsensitive domains, may play a role in directly providing information or otherwise providing positive outcomes \nto impacted people. However, automated systems should not be allowed to directly intervene in high-risk \nsituations, such as sentencing decisions or medical care, without human consideration. \nMeaningful access to examine the system. Designers, developers, and deployers of automated \nsystems should consider limited waivers of confidentiality (including those related to trade secrets) where \nnecessary in order to provide meaningful oversight of systems used in sensitive domains, incorporating mea\xad\nsures to protect intellectual property and trade secrets from unwarranted disclosure as appropriate. This \nincludes (potentially private and protected) meaningful access to source code, documentation, and related \ndata during any associated legal discovery, subject to effective confidentiality or court orders. Such meaning\xad\nful access should include (but is not limited to) adhering to the principle on Notice and Explanation using the \nhighest level of risk so the system is designed with built-in explanations; such systems should use fully-trans\xad\nparent models where the model itself can be understood by people needing to directly examine it. \nDemonstrate access to human alternatives, consideration, and fallback \nReporting. Reporting should include an assessment of timeliness and the extent of additional burden for \nhuman alternatives, aggregate statistics about who chooses the human alternative, along with the results of \nthe assessment about brevity, clarity, and accessibility of notice and opt-out instructions. Reporting on the \naccessibility, timeliness, and effectiveness of human consideration and fallback should be made public at regu\xad\nlar intervals for as long as the system is in use. This should include aggregated information about the number \nand type of requests for consideration, fallback employed, and any repeated requests; the timeliness of the \nhandling of these requests, including mean wait times for different types of requests as well as maximum wait \ntimes; and information about the procedures used to address requests for consideration along with the results \nof the evaluation of their accessibility. For systems used in sensitive domains, reporting should include infor\xad\nmation about training and governance procedures for these technologies.

The availability of human consideration and fallback, along with associated training and \nsafeguards against human bias, should be proportionate to the potential of the automated system to meaning\xad\nfully impact rights, opportunities, or access. Automated systems that have greater control over outcomes, \nprovide input to high-stakes decisions, relate to sensitive domains, or otherwise have a greater potential to \nmeaningfully impact rights, opportunities, or access should have greater availability (e.g., staffing) and over\xad\nsight of human consideration and fallback mechanisms. \nAccessible. Mechanisms for human consideration and fallback, whether in-person, on paper, by phone, or \notherwise provided, should be easy to find and use. These mechanisms should be tested to ensure that users \nwho have trouble with the automated system are able to use human consideration and fallback, with the under\xad\nstanding that it may be these users who are most likely to need the human assistance.
