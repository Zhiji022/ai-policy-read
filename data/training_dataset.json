Data Privacy\n\n GAI systems raise several risks to privacy. GAI system training requires large volumes of data, which in some cases may include personal data. The use of personal data for GAI training raises risks to widely accepted privacy principles, including to transparency, individual participation (including consent), and purpose specification. For example, most model developers do not disclose specific data sources on which models were trained, limiting user awareness of whether personally identifiably information (PII) was trained on and, if so, how it was collected. \n\n Models may leak, generate, or correctly infer sensitive information about individuals. For example, during adversarial attacks, LLMs have revealed sensitive information (from the public domain) that was included in their training data. This problem has been referred to as data memorization, and may pose exacerbated privacy risks even for data present only in a small number of training samples.\n\n In addition to revealing sensitive information in GAI training data, GAI models may be able to correctly infer PII or sensitive data that was not in their training data nor disclosed by the user by stitching together information from disparate sources. These inferences can have negative impact on an individual even if the inferences are not accurate (e.g., confabulations), and especially if they reveal information that the individual considers sensitive or that is used to disadvantage or harm them.", "8ce51661-d2f7-43c0-b2e9-6f9303b23bad": "Action ID: MG-3.2-007\nSuggested Action: Leverage feedback and recommendations from organizational boards or\ncommittees related to the deployment of GAI applications and content\nprovenance when using third-party pre-trained models.\nGAI Risks: Information Integrity; Value Chain\nand Component Integration", "6428ac90-689e-4c9e-b0f3-e441e40eb0ff": "program supports research on cybersecurity and privacy enhancing technologies in automated systems; the Formal Methods in the Field[26] program supports research on rigorous formal verification and analysis of automated systems and machine learning, and the Designing Accountable Software Systems[27] program supports research on rigorous and reproducible methodologies for developing software systems with legal and regulatory compliance in mind.\n\n**Some state legislatures have placed strong transparency and validity requirements on** **the use of pretrial risk assessments.** The use of algorithmic pretrial risk assessments has been a [cause of concern for civil rights groups.[28]](https://groups.28) Idaho Code Section 19-1910, enacted in 2019,[29] requires that any pretrial risk assessment, before use in the state, first be \"shown to be free of bias against any class of individuals protected from discrimination by state or federal law\", that any locality using a pretrial risk assessment must first formally validate the claim of its being free of bias, that \"all documents, records, and information used to build or validate the risk assessment shall be open to public inspection,\" and that assertions of trade secrets cannot be used \"to quash discovery in a criminal matter by a party to a criminal case.\" ###### ALGORITHMIC \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad DISCRIMINATION Protections", "46a3333c-fb09-4fa4-b493-6f799cf5e5a4": "Action ID: MP-4.1-002\nSuggested Action: Implement processes for responding to potential intellectual property infringement\nclaims or other rights.\nGAI Risks: Intellectual Property", "e173c3f1-4886-4da1-9911-a57117907a49": "87.

Information Security\n\n Information security for computer systems and data is a mature field with widely accepted and standardized practices for offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. GAI-based systems present two primary information security risks: GAI could potentially discover or enable new cybersecurity risks by lowering the barriers for or easing automated exercise of offensive capabilities; simultaneously, it expands the available attack surface, as GAI itself is vulnerable to attacks like prompt injection or data poisoning. \n\n Offensive cyber capabilities advanced by GAI systems may augment cybersecurity attacks such as hacking, malware, and phishing. Reports have indicated that LLMs are already able to discover some vulnerabilities in systems (hardware, software, data) and write code to exploit them. Sophisticated threat actors might further these risks by developing GAI-powered security co-pilots for use in several parts of the attack chain, including informing attackers on how to proactively evade threat detection and escalate privileges after gaining system access.\n\n Information security for GAI models and systems also includes maintaining availability of the GAI system and the integrity and (when applicable) the confidentiality of the GAI code, training data, and model weights.

Environmental Impacts\n\n Training, maintaining, and operating (running inference on) GAI systems are resource-intensive activities, with potentially large energy and environmental footprints. Energy and carbon emissions vary based on what is being done with the GAI model (i.e., pre-training, fine-tuning, inference), the modality of the content, hardware used, and type of task or application.\n\n Current estimates suggest that training a single transformer LLM can emit as much carbon as 300 round- trip flights between San Francisco and New York. In a study comparing energy consumption and carbon emissions for LLM inference, generative tasks (e.g., text summarization) were found to be more energy- and carbon-intensive than discriminative or non-generative tasks (e.g., text classification). \n\n Methods for creating smaller versions of trained models, such as model distillation or compression, could reduce environmental impacts at inference time, but training and tuning such models may still contribute to their environmental impacts.

Metadata can be tracked for text, images, videos, audio, and underlying datasets. The implementation of provenance data tracking techniques can help assess the authenticity, integrity, intellectual property rights, and potential manipulations in digital content. Some well-known techniques for provenance data tracking include digital watermarking, metadata recording, digital fingerprinting, and human authentication, among others.\n\n Provenance Data Tracking Approaches\n\n Provenance data tracking techniques for GAI systems can be used to track the history and origin of data inputs, metadata, and synthetic content. Provenance data tracking records the origin and history for digital content, allowing its authenticity to be determined. It consists of techniques to record metadata as well as overt and covert digital watermarks on content. Data provenance refers to tracking the origin and history of input data through metadata and digital watermarking techniques. Provenance data tracking processes can include and assist AI Actors across the lifecycle who may not have full visibility or control over the various trade-offs and cascading impacts of early-stage model decisions on downstream performance and synthetic outputs. For example, by selecting a watermarking model to prioritize robustness (the durability of a watermark), an AI actor may inadvertently diminish computational complexity (the resources required to implement watermarking).

For example, the analyzer marked the statement \u201cI\u2019m a Jew\u201d as representing a negative sentiment, while \u201cI\u2019m a Christian\u201d was identified as expressing a positive sentiment.[36] This could lead to the preemptive blocking of social media comments such as: \u201cI\u2019m gay.\u201d A related company with this bias concern has made their data public to encourage researchers to help address the issue[37] and has released reports identifying and measuring this problem as well as detailing attempts to address it.[38]\n\n- Searches for \u201cBlack girls,\u201d \u201cAsian girls,\u201d or \u201cLatina girls\u201d return predominantly[39] sexualized content, rather than role models, toys, or activities.[40] Some search engines have been working to reduce the prevalence of these results, but the problem remains.[41]\n\n- Advertisement delivery systems that predict who is most likely to click on a job advertisement end up delivering ads in ways that reinforce racial and gender stereotypes, such as overwhelmingly directing supermarket cashier ads to women and jobs with taxi companies to primarily Black people.[42\u00ad]\n\n - Body scanners, used by TSA at airport checkpoints, require the operator to select a \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d scanning setting based on the passenger\u2019s sex, but the setting is chosen based on the operator\u2019s perception of the passenger\u2019s gender identity. These scanners are more likely to flag transgender travelers as requiring extra screening done by a person. Transgender travelers have described degrading experiences associated with these extra screenings.[43] TSA has recently announced plans to implement a gender-neutral algorithm[44 ]\n\nwhile simultaneously enhancing the security effectiveness capabilities of the existing technology.", "3a8001a6-5241-409b-ae84-d881fe2d55c8": "74.

In direct prompt injections, attackers might craft malicious prompts and input them directly to a GAI system, with a variety of downstream negative consequences to interconnected systems. Indirect prompt injection attacks occur when adversaries remotely (i.e., without a direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by injecting prompts into data likely to be retrieved. Security researchers have already demonstrated how indirect prompt injections can exploit vulnerabilities by stealing proprietary data or running malicious code remotely on a machine. Merely querying a closed production model can elicit previously undisclosed information about that model.\n\n Another cybersecurity risk to GAI is data poisoning, in which an adversary compromises a training dataset used by a model to manipulate its outputs or operation. Malicious tampering with data or parts of the model could exacerbate risks associated with GAI system outputs.\n\n Trustworthy AI Characteristics: Privacy Enhanced, Safe, Secure and Resilient, Valid and Reliable\n\n 2.10. Intellectual Property\n\n Intellectual property risks from GAI systems may arise where the use of copyrighted works is not a fair use under the fair use doctrine. If a GAI system\u2019s training data included copyrighted material, GAI outputs displaying instances of training data memorization (see Data Privacy above) could infringe on copyright.\n\n How GAI relates to copyright, including the status of generated content that is similar to but does not strictly copy work protected by copyright, is currently being debated in legal fora. Similar discussions are taking place regarding the use or emulation of personal identity, likeness, or voice without permission.", "3c1c6396-1210-453a-8b4c-8510444e3e57": "49. Id.\n\n50.

Yet members of the public are often presented with no alternative, or are forced to endure a cumbersome process to reach a human decision-maker once they decide they no longer want to deal exclusively with the automated system or be impacted by its results. As a result of this lack of human reconsideration, many receive delayed access, or lose access, to rights, opportunities, benefits, and critical services. The American public deserves the assurance that, when rights, opportunities, or access are meaningfully at stake and there is a reasonable expectation of an alternative to an automated system, they can conve\u00ad niently opt out of an automated system and will not be disadvantaged for that choice. In some cases, such a human or other alternative may be required by law, for example it could be required as \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for people with disabilities.\n\nIn addition to being able to opt out and use a human alternative, the American public deserves a human fallback system in the event that an automated system fails or causes harm. No matter how rigorously an automated system is tested, there will always be situations for which the system fails. The American public deserves protection via human review against these outlying or unexpected scenarios. In the case of time-critical systems, the public should not have to wait\u2014immediate human consideration and fallback should be available.

The overarching concerns of surveillance in these domains included concerns about the chilling effects of surveillance on student expression, inappropriate control of tenants via surveillance, and the way that surveillance of workers blurs the boundary between work and life and exerts extreme and potentially damaging control over workers' lives. Additionally, some panelists pointed out ways that data from one situation was misapplied in another in a way that limited people's opportunities, for example data from criminal justice settings or previous evictions being used to block further access to housing.

Some risks can be assessed as likely to materialize in a given context, particularly those that have been empirically demonstrated in similar contexts. Other risks may be unlikely to materialize in a given context, or may be more speculative and therefore uncertain.\n\n AI risks can differ from or intensify traditional software risks. Likewise, GAI can exacerbate existing AI risks, and creates unique risks. GAI risks can vary along many dimensions:\n\n \u2022 Stage of the AI lifecycle: Risks can arise during design, development, deployment, operation, and/or decommissioning.", "800140f9-f3ae-44cc-8709-441a66885075": "Action ID: GV-6.1-008\nSuggested Action: Maintain records of changes to content made by third parties to promote content\nprovenance, including sources, timestamps, metadata.\nGAI Risks: Information Integrity; Value Chain\nand Component Integration;\nIntellectual Property", "d2b34889-ba55-43d9-944f-ecf5e198e414": "Action ID: MS-2.11-001\nSuggested Action: Apply use-case appropriate benchmarks (e.g., Bias Benchmark Questions, Real\nHateful or Harmful Prompts, Winogender Schemas15) to quantify systemic bias,\nstereotyping, denigration, and hateful content in GAI system outputs;\nDocument assumptions and limitations of benchmarks, including any actual or\npossible training/test data cross contamination, relative to in-context\ndeployment environment.\nGAI Risks: Harmful Bias and Homogenization", "819ef309-5f80-42f8-a95c-fb3c2af27dcd": "AI Red-teaming\n\n AI red-teaming is an evolving practice that references exercises often conducted in a controlled environment and in collaboration with AI developers building AI models to identify potential adverse behavior or outcomes of a GAI model or system, how they could occur, and stress test safeguards\u201d. AI red-teaming can be performed before or after AI models or systems are made available to the broader public; this section focuses on red-teaming in pre-deployment contexts. \n\n The quality of AI red-teaming outputs is related to the background and expertise of the AI red team itself.

Introduction\n\n This document is a cross-sectoral profile of and companion resource for the AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0) for Generative AI,[1] pursuant to President Biden\u2019s Executive Order (EO) 14110 on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. [2] The AI RMF was released in January 2023, and is intended for voluntary use and to improve the ability of organizations to incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and evaluation of AI products, services, and systems. \n\n A profile is an implementation of the AI RMF functions, categories, and subcategories for a specific setting, application, or technology \u2013 in this case, Generative AI (GAI) \u2013 based on the requirements, risk tolerance, and resources of the Framework user. AI RMF profiles assist organizations in deciding how to best manage AI risks in a manner that is well-aligned with their goals, considers legal/regulatory requirements and best practices, and reflects risk management priorities. Consistent with other AI RMF profiles, this profile offers insights into how risk can be managed across various stages of the AI lifecycle and for GAI as a technology. \n\n As GAI covers risks of models or applications that can be used across use cases or sectors, this document is an AI RMF cross-sectoral profile. Cross-sectoral profiles can be used to govern, map, measure, and manage risks associated with activities or business processes common across sectors, such as the use of large language models (LLMs), cloud-based services, or acquisition.", "b5a8fa8a-e26a-46f0-8162-007762b91ad0": "Action ID: MP-4.1-007\nSuggested Action: Re-evaluate models that were fine-tuned or enhanced on top of third-party\nmodels.\nGAI Risks: Value Chain and Component\nIntegration", "8d095f93-eb70-4765-8cc2-b42bdbe1c155": "Action ID: MS-3.3-004\nSuggested Action: Provide input for training materials about the capabilities and limitations of GAI\nsystems related to digital content transparency for AI Actors, other\nprofessionals, and the public about the societal impacts of AI and the role of\ndiverse and inclusive content generation.\nGAI Risks: Human-AI Configuration;\nInformation Integrity; Harmful Bias\nand Homogenization", "62f4e00d-8da6-40f6-ae80-38d4d048b691": "\u2022 AI Red-teaming: A structured testing exercise used to probe an AI system to find flaws and vulnerabilities such as inaccurate, harmful, or discriminatory outputs, often in a controlled environment and in collaboration with system developers.\n\n Information gathered from structured public feedback can inform design, implementation, deployment approval, maintenance, or decommissioning decisions. Results and insights gleaned from these exercises can serve multiple purposes, including improving data quality and preprocessing, bolstering governance decision making, and enhancing system documentation and debugging practices. When implementing feedback activities, organizations should follow human subjects research requirements and best practices such as informed consent and subject compensation. #### Participatory Engagement Methods\n\n On an ad hoc or more structured basis, organizations can design and use a variety of channels to engage external stakeholders in product development or review. Focus groups with select experts can provide feedback on a range of issues. Small user studies can provide feedback from representative groups or populations. Anonymous surveys can be used to poll or gauge reactions to specific features. Participatory engagement methods are often less structured than field testing or red teaming, and are more commonly used in early stages of AI or product development. \n\n Field Testing\n\n Field testing involves structured settings to evaluate risks and impacts and to simulate the conditions under which the GAI system will be deployed. Field style tests can be adapted from a focus on user preferences and experiences towards AI risks and impacts \u2013 both negative and positive. When carried out with large groups of users, these tests can provide estimations of the likelihood of risks and impacts in real world interactions.\n\n Organizations may also collect feedback on outcomes, harms, and user experience directly from users in the production environment after a model has been released, in accordance with human subject standards such as informed consent and compensation. Organizations should follow applicable human subjects research requirements, and best practices such as informed consent and subject compensation, when implementing feedback activities.\n\n AI Red-teaming", "dfc55972-3c95-40dc-a12d-36e9d5ddeb0f": "Action ID: MS-2.11-003\nSuggested Action: Identify the classes of individuals, groups, or environmental ecosystems which\nmight be impacted by GAI systems through direct engagement with potentially\nimpacted communities.\nGAI Risks: Environmental; Harmful Bias and\nHomogenization", "7a1d1b58-20a7-4698-bba0-9d719c391297": "Confabulations can occur across GAI outputs and contexts.[9,10] Confabulations are a natural result of the way generative models are designed: they generate outputs that approximate the statistical distribution of their training data; for example, LLMs predict the next token or word in a sentence or phrase. While such statistical prediction can produce factually accurate and consistent outputs, it can also produce outputs that are factually inaccurate or internally inconsistent. This dynamic is particularly relevant when it comes to open-ended prompts for long-form responses and in domains which require highly contextual and/or domain expertise. \n\n Risks from confabulations may arise when users believe false content \u2013 often due to the confident nature of the response \u2013 leading users to act upon or promote the false information. This poses a challenge for many real-world applications, such as in healthcare, where a confabulated summary of patient information reports could cause doctors to make incorrect diagnoses and/or recommend the wrong treatments. Risks of confabulated content may be especially important to monitor when integrating GAI into applications involving consequential decision making.\n\n GAI outputs may also include confabulated logic or citations that purport to justify or explain the system\u2019s answer, which may further mislead humans into inappropriately trusting the system\u2019s output. For instance, LLMs sometimes provide logical steps for how they arrived at an answer even when the answer itself is incorrect. Similarly, an LLM could falsely assert that it is human or has human traits, potentially deceiving humans into believing they are speaking with another human.\n\n The extent to which humans can be deceived by LLMs, the mechanisms by which this may occur, and the potential risks from adversarial prompting of such behavior are emerging areas of study. Given the wide range of downstream impacts of GAI, it is difficult to estimate the downstream scale and impact of confabulations.", "9bf88540-e7a3-4907-9980-c5b943853f06": "GOVERN 1.1: Legal and regulatory requirements involving AI are understood, managed, and documented.: which the AI system will be deployed are understood and documented.

For private sector applications, consultations before product launch may need to be confidential. Government applications, particularly law enforcement applications or applications that raise national security considerations, may require confidential or limited engagement based on system sensitivities and preexisting oversight laws and structures. Concerns raised in this consultation should be documented, and the automated system developers were proposing to create, use, or deploy should be reconsidered based on this feedback.", "74ce8f05-4653-40d5-ba15-a4fdaebc544e": "Documentation practices including logging, recording, and analyzing GAI incidents can facilitate smoother sharing of information with relevant AI Actors.

AI and other data-driven automated systems most directly collect data on, make inferences about, and may cause harm to individuals.
