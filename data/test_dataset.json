No alternative human option was readily available, which denied many people access to benefits.[101]\n\n- A fraud detection system for unemployment insurance distribution incorrectly flagged entries as fraudulent, leading to people with slight discrepancies or complexities in their files having their wages withheld and tax returns seized without any chance to explain themselves or receive a review by a person.[102]\n\n- A patient was wrongly denied access to pain medication when the hospital\u2019s software confused her medica\u00ad\n\ntion history with that of her dog\u2019s.

Results and insights gleaned from these exercises can serve multiple purposes, including improving data quality and preprocessing, bolstering governance decision making, and enhancing system documentation and debugging practices. When implementing feedback activities, organizations should follow human subjects research requirements and best practices such as informed consent and subject compensation. #### Participatory Engagement Methods\n\n On an ad hoc or more structured basis, organizations can design and use a variety of channels to engage external stakeholders in product development or review. Focus groups with select experts can provide feedback on a range of issues. Small user studies can provide feedback from representative groups or populations. Anonymous surveys can be used to poll or gauge reactions to specific features. Participatory engagement methods are often less structured than field testing or red teaming, and are more commonly used in early stages of AI or product development. \n\n Field Testing\n\n Field testing involves structured settings to evaluate risks and impacts and to simulate the conditions under which the GAI system will be deployed. Field style tests can be adapted from a focus on user preferences and experiences towards AI risks and impacts \u2013 both negative and positive. When carried out with large groups of users, these tests can provide estimations of the likelihood of risks and impacts in real world interactions.\n\n Organizations may also collect feedback on outcomes, harms, and user experience directly from users in the production environment after a model has been released, in accordance with human subject standards such as informed consent and compensation. Organizations should follow applicable human subjects research requirements, and best practices such as informed consent and subject compensation, when implementing feedback activities.\n\n AI Red-teaming", "ec343c6f-3c03-4cf8-b809-364ecbc2490c": "In discussion of technical and governance interventions that that are needed to protect against the harms of these technologies, panelists individually described the importance of: receiving community input into the design and use of technologies, public reporting on crucial elements of these systems, better notice and consent procedures that ensure privacy based on context and use case, ability to opt-out of using these systems and receive a fallback to a human process, providing explanations of decisions and how these systems work, the need for governance including training in using these systems, ensuring the technological use cases are genuinely related to the goal task and are locally validated to work, and the need for institution and protection of third party audits to ensure systems continue to be accountable and valid. ###### APPENDIX\n\n**Panel 4: Artificial Intelligence and Democratic Values.** This event examined challenges and opportunities in the design of technology that can help support a democratic vision for AI.

Overview of Risks Unique to or Exacerbated by GAI\n\n In the context of the AI RMF, risk refers to the composite measure of an event\u2019s probability (or likelihood) of occurring and the magnitude or degree of the consequences of the corresponding event. Some risks can be assessed as likely to materialize in a given context, particularly those that have been empirically demonstrated in similar contexts. Other risks may be unlikely to materialize in a given context, or may be more speculative and therefore uncertain.\n\n AI risks can differ from or intensify traditional software risks. Likewise, GAI can exacerbate existing AI risks, and creates unique risks. GAI risks can vary along many dimensions:\n\n \u2022 Stage of the AI lifecycle: Risks can arise during design, development, deployment, operation, and/or decommissioning.", "9594ebee-342c-4aa0-a369-30de2d4d4ab4": "Action ID: MP-5.1-002\nSuggested Action: Identify potential content provenance harms of GAI, such as misinformation or\ndisinformation, deepfakes, including NCII, or tampered content.

This technical assistance also provides practical tips to employers on how to comply with the ADA, and to job applicants and employees who think that their rights may have been violated.\n\n**Disparity assessments identified harms to Black patients' healthcare access.** A widely used healthcare algorithm relied on the cost of each patient\u2019s past medical care to predict future medical needs, recommending early interventions for the patients deemed most at risk. This process discriminated against Black patients, who generally have less access to medical care and therefore have generated less cost than white patients with similar illness and need. A landmark study documented this pattern and proposed practical ways that were shown to reduce this bias, such as focusing specifically on active chronic health [conditions or avoidable future costs related to emergency visits and hospitalization.[54]](https://hospitalization.54)\n\n**Large employers have developed best practices to scrutinize the data and models used** **for hiring.** An industry initiative has developed Algorithmic Bias Safeguards for the Workforce, a structured questionnaire that businesses can use proactively when procuring software to evaluate workers. It covers specific technical questions such as the training data used, model training process, biases identified, and [mitigation steps employed.[55]](https://employed.55)", "0b2b8384-2c81-47ff-a70b-fe76253a71ee": "Bias is mutually reinforcing with the problem of undesired homogenization, in which GAI systems produce skewed distributions of outputs that are overly uniform (for example, repetitive aesthetic styles #### and reduced content diversity). Overly homogenized outputs can themselves be incorrect, or they may lead to unreliable decision-making or amplify harmful biases. These phenomena can flow from foundation models to downstream models and systems, with the foundation models acting as \u201cbottlenecks,\u201d or single points of failure. \n\n Overly homogenized content can contribute to \u201cmodel collapse.\u201d Model collapse can occur when model training over-relies on synthetic data, resulting in data points disappearing from the distribution of the new model\u2019s outputs. In addition to threatening the robustness of the model overall, model collapse could lead to homogenized outputs, including by amplifying any homogenization from the model used to generate the synthetic training data.\n\n Trustworthy AI Characteristics: Fair with Harmful Bias Managed, Valid and Reliable\n\n 2.7. Human-AI Configuration\n\n GAI system use can involve varying risks of misconfigurations and poor interactions between a system and a human who is interacting with it. Humans bring their unique perspectives, experiences, or domain- specific expertise to interactions with AI systems but may not have detailed knowledge of AI systems and how they work. As a result, human experts may be unnecessarily \u201caverse\u201d to GAI systems, and thus deprive themselves or others of GAI\u2019s beneficial uses. \n\n Conversely, due to the complexity and increasing reliability of GAI technology, over time, humans may over-rely on GAI systems or may unjustifiably perceive GAI content to be of higher quality than that produced by other sources. This phenomenon is an example of automation bias, or excessive deference to automated systems. Automation bias can exacerbate other risks of GAI, such as risks of confabulation or risks of bias or homogenization.", "e65c41ca-f409-4007-9884-b218299f6a04": "**COMMUNITIES: \u201cCommunities\u201d include: neighborhoods; social network connections (both online and** offline); families (construed broadly); people connected by affinity, identity, or shared traits; and formal organizational ties.

AI and other data-driven automated systems most directly collect data on, make inferences about, and may cause harm to individuals. But the overall magnitude of their impacts may be most readily visible at the level of communities. Accordingly, the concept of community is integral to the scope of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. United States law and policy have long employed approaches for protecting the rights of individuals, but existing frameworks have sometimes struggled to provide protections when effects manifest most clearly at a community level.

Introduction\n\n This document is a cross-sectoral profile of and companion resource for the AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0) for Generative AI,[1] pursuant to President Biden\u2019s Executive Order (EO) 14110 on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. [2] The AI RMF was released in January 2023, and is intended for voluntary use and to improve the ability of organizations to incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and evaluation of AI products, services, and systems. \n\n A profile is an implementation of the AI RMF functions, categories, and subcategories for a specific setting, application, or technology \u2013 in this case, Generative AI (GAI) \u2013 based on the requirements, risk tolerance, and resources of the Framework user. AI RMF profiles assist organizations in deciding how to best manage AI risks in a manner that is well-aligned with their goals, considers legal/regulatory requirements and best practices, and reflects risk management priorities. Consistent with other AI RMF profiles, this profile offers insights into how risk can be managed across various stages of the AI lifecycle and for GAI as a technology. \n\n As GAI covers risks of models or applications that can be used across use cases or sectors, this document is an AI RMF cross-sectoral profile. Cross-sectoral profiles can be used to govern, map, measure, and manage risks associated with activities or business processes common across sectors, such as the use of large language models (LLMs), cloud-based services, or acquisition.", "7d9225be-cc4d-4935-977c-1b30e2d15dcc": "Rafat, K. et al.
